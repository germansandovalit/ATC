If love is blind
Why do we got to be pretty all the time?
(Girls, girls)

You tell me I never smile
You tell me I talk too much
It feels like I'm under fire
It feels like I'm not enough
I won't let you bring me down
Gotta let all of me out
I don't need to look so perfect
To make me feel like I'm worth it now

If love is blind

If love is blind

(Girls, girls)

Don't tell me that I look tired
I'm already in my head
Don't tell me that I look better
With my hair up, dressed up, make-up
Don't need you telling me how
I could look beautiful now
If I live up to your standards
I'll break under the pressure now (Girls)
