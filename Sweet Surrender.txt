Echoes in the dark
You called out my name
I chained myself in a cellar
Built out of failure and shame
You try to give me shelter
I kept choosing the rain
I'm standing on a ledge
Above a fall I can't face
But you pushed me anyway

You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender
You wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours
So tell me will you stay now?
'Cause I feel like I'm saved now
You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender

Didn't even try to cry out for help
The only thing he ever did was help me destroy myself
I'm better now with you, even when I'm in hell
You pick me up, pull me out like nobody else
Yeah, you pushed the ground away

You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender
You wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours
So tell me will you stay now?
'Cause I feel like I'm saved now
You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender

I take off my armour when you love me harder
All my defences come down
I take off my armour when you love me harder
I'm alright, I'm alright now

You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender
You wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours
So tell me will you stay now?
'Cause I feel like I'm saved now
You got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender

I take off my armour when you love me harder
All my defences come down
I take off my armour when you love me harder
I'm alright, I'm alright now
