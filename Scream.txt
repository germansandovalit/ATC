These two years have gone so fast
Making bitter memories
You know you've always been the best
At bringing out the worst in me

Its torture when I say it's over
It's never for sure
But damn, it's got a hold on me

You swear you're gonna leave
I wish you would
I'd beat you to the punch if I could

You make me scream
And I try and I try and I try
But you keep on pushing me (pushing me)
Oh, pretty please
Why don't you leave
'Cause it's cool when it's good
But the bad's got me in agony (agony)
Just let me be
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah

I don't need to play your games
Only call it how I see
'Cause it don't matter what I say
You turn it back around on me

Its torture when I say it's over
It's never for sure
But damn, it's got a hold on me

You make me scream
And I try and I try and I try
But you keep on pushing me (pushing me)
Oh, pretty please
Why don't you leave
'Cause it's cool when it's good
But the bad's got me in agony (agony)
Just let me be
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah

You swear you're gonna leave
I wish you would
I'd beat you to the punch if I could
You swear you're gonna leave
I wish you would
I'd beat you to the punch if I could

You make me scream
And I try and I try and I try
But you keep on pushing me (pushing me)
Oh, pretty please
Why don't you leave
'Cause it's cool when it's good
But the bad's got me in agony (agony)
Just let me be
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah
You make me scream, aah
